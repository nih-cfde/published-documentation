cfde_id_namespace:2	1419f08f554e0c93f3b62fe90c004066				Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi-omics Database (IBDMDB)	The main Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Multi-omics Database (IBDMDB) study includes multi-omics measurements from over 100 subjects, sampled biweekly over up to a year in both adult and pediatric patients with IBD (Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis), along with non-IBD controls. Data types include fecal metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metabolomes, and proteomes, as well as host genetics, intestinal biopsy transcriptomes, epigenetics, and 16S amplicon profiles.

Close to 20 million individuals in the United States have T2D, and 79 million aged 20 years or older are clinically pre-diabetic, with a 5-year conversion rate of 10% to 23% from prediabetes to T2D. In a collaborative effort to systematically understand diabetes and its etiology, the team is comprised of leading experts in research on both the human host as well as the microbiome, as properties of both are likely relevant in
