C2M2 Level 0 defines a **minimal valid C2M2 instance.** Data submissions
at this level of metadata richness will be the easiest to produce, and will
support the simplest available functionality implemented by
downstream applications.

#### Level 0 submission process: overview

Metadata submissions at Level 0 will consist of a single TSV
file describing a **collection of digital
files** owned or managed by a DCC. The properties listed
for the Level 0 `file` entity (see below for
diagram and definitions) will serve as the TSV's column
headers; each TSV row will represent a single file. The
Level 0 TSV itself thus represents a
**[manifest](../draft-CFDE_glossary/glossary.md#CFDE-asset-manifest)
or inventory** of digital files that a DCC wants to
introduce into the C2M2 metadata ecosystem.

This level encodes the most basic file metadata:
its use by downstream applications will be
limited to informing the least specific level of data
accounting, querying and reporting.

#### Level 0 technical specification: properties of the `file` entity

**Required: `id_namespace` `id` `sha256|md5`**

|property|description|
|:---:|:---|
| `id_namespace` | String **identifier given by CFDE to the DCC managing this `file`**. The value of this property will be used together with `id` (assigned to each `file` by the DCC that owns it) as a **paired-key structure formally identifying Level 0 `file` entities** within the total C2M2 data space.|
| `id` | Unrestricted-format **string identifying this `file`, assigned by the DCC managing it**. Can be any string as long as it **uniquely identifies each `file`** within the scope defined by the accompanying `id_namespace` value. |
| `persistent_id` | **A persistent, resolvable URI generated by a DCC** (using, e.g., the CFDE minid server) **and permanently attached to this `file`**, to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this `file`) and other relevant annotations and functions can eventually be attached, including (optionally) resolution to a network location from which the `file` can be downloaded. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier**: one level of indirection is required in order to allow network addresses to change over time as files are moved around. |
| `size_in_bytes` | The **size of this `file` in bytes**. This varies (even for "copies" of the same `file`) across differences in storage hardware and operating system. CFDE does not require any particular method of byte computation: file size integrity metadata will be provided in the form of checksum data in the `sha256` and/or `md5` properties. `size_in_bytes` will instead underpin automatic reporting of basic storage statistics across different C2M2 collections of DCC metadata.|
| `sha256` | **CFDE-preferred** file checksum string: the output of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function after being run on this `file`. One or both of `sha256` and `md5` is required. |
| `md5` | **Permitted** file checksum string: the output of the MD5 message-digest algorithm after being run as a cryptographic hash function on this `file`. One or both of `sha256` and `md5` is required. (CFDE recommends SHA-256 if feasible, but we recognize the nontrivial overhead involved in recomputing these hash values for large collections of files, so if MD5 values have already been generated, CFDE will accept them.) |
| `filename` | A filename with no prepended PATH information. |

#### Level 0 metadata submission examples: Data Package JSON Schema and example TSVs

A JSON Schema document -- implementing [Frictionless
Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/)'s "[Data
Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-package/)" container meta-specification --
defining the Level 0 TSV is
