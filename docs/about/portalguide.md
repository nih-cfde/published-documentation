# Portal and Dashboard User Guide

## Introduction

This document decribes the features and basic navigation of the CFDE portal. If you are looking for documentation on using the submission system specifically, [that documentation is here](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki).

### Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)

The CFDE is an effort to identify and solve issues that inhibit data access and reuse across NIH Common Fund (CF) programs. The goal of the CFDE is for Common Fund data to be more usable and useful both within a single program and among data sets from multiple programs. By connecting the data sets and making them more accessible, the CFDE is intended to enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, including hypothesis generation, discovery, and validation.

The specific goals of the CFDE are to:

*   Increase usability – enable the uptake, reuse, and creation of Common Fund (CF) data and tools.
*   Preserve data – support the storage, sharing, and sustainability of CF data sets.
*   Provide training – maximize scientists’ ability to use CF data and other resources.

### Purpose of this Document

The CFDE website includes two modules to ensure the specific goals are met and users can find data—the [portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) and the [dashboard](https://https://app.nih-cfde.org/udashboard.html). This document describes those modules in detail. The goals of both the portal and the dashboard are to establish FAIR data production by:

*   **F** – Providing rich metadata using an entity-relationship model to express relationships between diverse data elements.
*   **A** – Offering rich access control and access to metadata via standard HTTP web service interfaces.
*   **I** – Integrating with standardized terms defined by collaborators, consortium, and communities.
*   **R** – Supporting dynamic model evolution so the presented data accurately represents the current structure and state of knowledge within an investigation.

To support these principals, the dashboard and data browser within the portal emphasize well-defined metadata and data models, use controlled vocabularies and ontologies, allow others to reproduce experiments, etc.

### Login

Some features are available without logging in, but to save queries and access your personalized dashboard, you must log in.

## Portal

The CFDE portal is a hub for searching the CFDE data across all programs. The main page of the portal (shown below) is meant for high-level decision-making, whereas the repository (or “data browser”) allows users such as clinical researchers, bioinformatics power users, and NIH program officers to search for CFDE data.

From the portal, you can:

*  View and export a dashboard bar chart.
*  Explore the repository of Common Fund data.
*  Access the full dashboard with additional summary charts.
*  Read documentation about the C2M2 and FAIR Cookbook.
*  See the latest news regarding the CFDE.

![alt_text](../images/Portal_Home.png "Portal Home")

### Access the Portal

Access the portal directly by using this link: [https://app.nih-cfde.org/](https://app.nih-cfde.org/).


### Filter the Chart

The portal chart is an interactive graphic that renders automatically when different criteria are selected from the X-axis, Y-axis, and Stack By drop-downs. For example, the chart below shows the number of files by assay for each data type.

![alt_text](../images/Summary_View_Chart.png "Preview the data chart")

To filter the portal chart:

1. Select an **X-axis** value from the drop-down. Options include:
    - CF Program
    - Data Type
    - Assay
    - Species
    - Anatomy
    - Disease

    The horizontal axis of the bar chart updates automatically with the option selected.

2. Select a **Y-axis** value from the drop-down. Options include:
    *   File Count
    *   Data Volume
    *   Sample Count
    *   Subject Count

    The vertical axis of the bar chart updates automatically with the option selected.

3. Select a **Stack By** value from the drop-down. Options include:
    *   CF Program
    *   Data Type
    *   Assay
    *   Species
    *   Anatomy
    *   Disease

    The bars are stacked/sorted automatically with the option selected and the color-coded key updates with the appropriate categories.

---

NOTE: The same X-axis option cannot be selected for the Stacked By option, so the corresponding option in the Stacked By drop-down will be disabled if it is already selected in the X-axis drop-down.

---

### Download the Chart

The Download icon (![alt_text](../images/Download_Button.png "Download Button")) displays next to each chart to export the data as a PNG, SVG, or CSV file. The PNG and SVG exports are image files of the chart, whereas the CSV export is a spreadsheet of the data.

*   A personalized dashboard that is available after [logging in](#login).

The CFDE dashboard displays multiple charts for users to view high-level data. The charts update automatically with the selections you make and the precise numbers can be viewed by hovering over the chart. The charts include:

*   Bar chart of the file count by Common Fund program and assay. The X-axis, Y-axis, and Stack are configurable by all users to customize the data summary as needed.
*   Bar chart of the subject count by data type and Common Fund program. The X-axis, Y-axis, and Stack are configurable by all users to customize the data summary as needed.
*   Pie chart of the number of subjects by anatomy for a single assay type across all Common Fund programs.
*   Pie chart of the number of samples by anatomy for a single Common Fund program.
*   Bar chart of the file count by data type and assay. The X-axis, Y-axis, and Stack are configurable by all users to customize the data summary as needed.
