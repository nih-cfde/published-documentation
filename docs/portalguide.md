# Portal and Dashboard User Guide

## Introduction

This document describes the features and basic navigation of the CFDE portal. If you are looking for documentation on using the submission system specifically, [that documentation is here](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki).

### Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)

The NIH Common Fund (CF) has funded a wide variety of data types and studies that are of interest to clinical and biomedical researchers, however, those datasets are hosted on an equally large number of websites, with varying query systems. The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal is a unified system for searching across the entire CF portfolio in a single search and is the first step in addressing the goal of making CF data more Find-able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The wide range of data types, models, and formats used by Common Fund Programs are being harmonized using well-defined metadata, and common controlled vocabularies using the Crosscut Metadata Model.

The CFDE Search Portal uses the Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2), a flexible metadata standard for describing experimental resources in biomedicine and related fields. This portal supports faceted searches of metadata concepts such as anatomical location, species, and assay type, across a wide variety of datasets using a controlled vocabulary (we do not currently support protected metadata). This allows researchers to find a wide variety of data that would otherwise need to be searched individually, using varying nomenclatures. The portal only accepts C2M2 data packages from Common Fund Programs.

The CFDE is an effort to identify and solve issues that inhibit data access and reuse across NIH CF programs. The goal of the CFDE is for Common Fund data to be more usable and useful both within a single program and among datasets from multiple programs. By connecting the datasets and making them more accessible, the CFDE is intended to enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, including hypothesis generation, discovery, and validation.

The specific goals of the CFDE are to:

*   Increase usability – enable the uptake, reuse, and creation of Common Fund (CF) data and tools.
*   Preserve data – support the storage, sharing, and sustainability of CF datasets.
*   Provide training – maximize scientists’ ability to use CF data and other resources.

### Purpose of this Document

The CFDE website includes two modules to ensure the specific goals are met and users can find data—the [portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) and the [dashboard](https://app.nih-cfde.org/udashboard.html). This document describes those modules in detail. The goals of both the portal and the dashboard are to establish FAIR data production by:

*   **F**indable – Providing rich metadata using an entity-relationship model to express relationships between diverse data elements.
*   **A**ccessible – Offering rich access control and access to metadata via standard HTTP web service interfaces.
*   **I**nteroperable – Integrating with standardized terms defined by collaborators, consortium, and communities.
*   **R**eusable – Supporting dynamic model evolution so the presented data accurately represents the current structure and state of knowledge within an investigation.

To support these principles, the dashboard and data browser within the portal emphasize well-defined metadata and data models, use controlled vocabularies and ontologies, allow others to reproduce experiments, etc.

### Sort and View Search Results

The data browser search results can be sorted and viewed using the following functions:

*   The results table can be sorted by column header using the arrow icon (![alt_text](../images/Arrow_Button.png "Arrow Button")
).
*   View a different amount of results on one page by selecting a different option for the **Displaying first number of records** drop-down.

![alt_text](../images/Number_of_Records.png "Number of Records")

*   Use the **Search All Columns** search box at the top of the results table to search for records within the table. The search box may include other terms such as 'collection' or 'project' depending on the search criteria.

![alt_text](../images/Search_All_Columns.png "Search All Columns")

*   View additional results by clicking the **Next** button at the bottom of the table.
*   Click the **X** next to the filter to remove the one filter from the search results.

![alt_text](../images/Clear_All_Filters.png "Clear All Filters")

*   Click **Clear All Filters** to remove all filters from the search results.

### Export Search Results

Search results can be exported from the data browser when viewing the core C2M2 tables. The *collection, file, biosample*, and *subject* tables show **Collection BDBAG, File BDBAG, Biosample BDBAG**, and **Subject BDBAG** export options, respectively. The file table adds an **NCPI file manifest** option not applicable to the other C2M2 tables.

The various BDBAG options produce a so-called Big-Data Bag which is a zipfile with multiple, CSV-formatted tabular data files and other supporting metadata. Generally, the CSV file content will have columns following the C2M2 model specification. When run on a search page with paginated results, the export will represent all matching results for the search criteria. When run on a single (detailed) record page, the export will represent that single record as the main result. There will be a CSV file representing the main record(s) as well as other CSV files representing related content from other C2M2 tables.

The personal collection feature mimics the same export options as the C2M2 file table. However, export is only offered from each detailed personal collection page. This page represents a manually curated set of file records, and so produces exports as if a search were performed with this specific set of matching files.

1. Click the **Export** button.

    ![alt_text](../images/Export_Options_v2.png "Export Options")

2. Select **CSV**, **BDBAG**, or **NCPI file manifest**. The options that display will depend on which page you are on:
    *   CSV – Opens a .csv file in Excel that includes the metadata displayed in the search results in tabular format. 
    *   BDBAG – Downloads the data to a .bag file used for storing ROS message data. Use this option if you want to download large files or if a particular dataset includes many files.
    *   NCPI file manifest - for File exports. This option exports the BDBAG data plus the actual files associated with the record pages. The file includes the DRS_URI that includes a link to the file information. Note that the file must have a Persistent ID to view the DRS_URI.

### Save Searches

On any data browser page, you can save searches and easily return to them later through your [personalized dashboard](#navigate-the-personalized-dashboard).
