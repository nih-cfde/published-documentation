# Welcome to the Documentation for the CFDE

The goal of Common Fund Data Ecosystem CFDE is to federate data from a number of Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to improve access to data derived from hundreds of studies and samples collected from thousands of human subjects. This project involves a diversity of datatypes has been generated at the genomic, expression, proteomic, metagenomic, and imaging levels, and the DCCs support a tremendous range of scientific discovery efforts.
To facilitate this task, of the CFDE have developed and refined software tools. To view documentation for these tools, please select from the following:

- The [Crosscut Metadata Model](./spec-and-docs/C2M2-usage-guides-and-technical-documents/000-INTRODUCTION.md) (C2M2), a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental data.
- The [FAIR cookbook](./the-fair-cookbook/content/intro.md) provides introductory materials about various aspects of FAIRness, including practical guides that show how to enhance digital objects by adhering them to community accepted standards.
