# CFDE Published Documentation Release Plan

This is the release plan for the [CFDE Published Documentation website](https://cfde-published-documentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

## Release Documentation

The Github repo for the published documentation website will host a release section and associated tag information.

For documentation version numbering system we will follow the release semantics with Major and Minor numbering. Thus our release tag would have the format: **`Major.Minor`**

The current version of the published documentation is at `v1.0`. Any subsequent updates via PRs to the repo will be documented and can be released as either a `Minor` or `Major` release depending on the scope of the content. For example updates to an existing use case might be might be considered a minor update with tag as **`v1.1`**.

A draft of the release notes will be auto generated based on PR merges into `latest`.
To access the draft
- access the `Releases` tab on the main repo page
- click on `Create a new release`
- subsequently click on `Releases`
- use the `Edit` button on the right top corner
- modify the release titles, add date if applicable and save draft

Note that the draft of the release notes will not be auto published and requires manual action to edit and publish. The current setup bumps up the tag for every release by one `Minor` number. For example from `v1.1` to `v1.2`. If the changes constitute a major release tag prior to reaching the before the natural succession, this can be manually changed in the tag and title of the draft. For example from `v1.4` to `v2.0`. Subsequent tags will be auto-adjusted to the new version.

The tag is autogenerated. It is important to tag the correct version of `latest` branch and is the current default setting. The
`Target` for tag can be updated if not already set to `latest` after the merge of individual PRs
    - Click the `Edit` option on the autogenerated release draft
    - Ensure `Target` branch is set to `latest`
    - Click `Publish release` after checking for contents
    - This will create the public release visible on main repo page

Note that the very first release draft will not have version number and has to be manually added to the title of the draft as well as the tag. All subsequent release drafts will be automatically versioned and tagged.
